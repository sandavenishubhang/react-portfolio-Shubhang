export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
      My journey into the world of data analytics began with a deep curiosity for uncovering patterns and insights hidden within data. 
      With a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Mahindra Ã‰cole Centrale, Hyderabad, I laid the foundation for my technical skills, which I have since refined through my Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston.
  
      Over the years, I have gained hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and R, alongside tools like Tableau and Power BI, allowing me to transform raw data into meaningful insights. My professional journey includes working as a Data Analyst at Deep Red Ink Digital Marketing Agency, where I optimized workflows, developed interactive dashboards, and delivered data-driven solutions that enhanced client satisfaction and performance.
  
      Through academic and professional projects, I have designed ETL pipelines, built predictive models, and implemented clustering techniques to solve real-world challenges. This journey has been shaped by a constant drive to learn, adapt, and innovate, equipping me with the skills to approach data challenges from multiple perspectives and deliver impactful results.
  
      I am passionate about leveraging data to tell compelling stories and empower decision-making, always aiming to make a positive impact through my work.
